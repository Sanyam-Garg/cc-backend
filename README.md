# Task 1: Fetching and Storing
Hope you went through the python basic principles playlist shared earlier. In this task, you will be applying that knowledge and more to GET football competition data from an open API and storing the same in a CSV file.

## About the API
The API you will be using is the [Football Data API](https://www.football-data.org/) 
If you go through the API's documentation, you will find multiple _endpoints_ listed. However, you will be using the [Competetion Data](https://api.football-data.org/v2/competitions/) endpoint for this task.
_You can read more about this endpoint in their documentation_

## About the task
* Every single response returned by the endpoint has a field called `plan`, which contains the TIER of the competition listed. 
* Your task is to create a python program that takes input the **tier** value from the user and then stores the corresponding competitions in a CSV file.
* The following is the recommended format of storing the CSV file.

|id|Name|Area/Country|Available Seasons|Tier|
|----|----|----|----|----|
|6942|Coupe de Belgique|Belgium|4|TIER_THREE|

## Format of submission
* You have to make a GitHub account (if you don't have one yet) and push all the code to a repository. _You can learn about Git and Github from the resources section below_
* A google form will be floated wherein you will have to share the GitHub repository for the task. **Make sure the repository is public**.

##  Timeline
You have three days to complete the above task. In other words, the deadline of the task is 4 Feb EOD (12:00 AM at night)
